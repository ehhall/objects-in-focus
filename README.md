# Objects in Focus

This is a suite of data and tools for mapping fixations to objects segmented from cluttered, real-world scenes. Github and paper are a work in progress. We would recommend that you wait before using any of the data/code in any official capacity, but if you do, please consider citing the papers in the Documentation section :) 

## Google Colab

Notebook with some functions for mapping segmentations and fixations. Full tutorial notebook coming soon!
